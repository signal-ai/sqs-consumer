# SQS Consumer
[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/sqs-consumer.svg)](https://clojars.org/sqs-consumer)

## Rationale

There are a few alternative SQS queuing libraries. None of them focus on creating components that can easily be started and stopped gracefully. This library focusses on solving just that problem.

Libraries should tie you into using the fewest number of other libraries as possible. For example this library will never tie you into an implementation of components such as Stuart Sierra's components or Mount components. This library should work with what ever choice you make. The same is true for async code, we don't want to tie you into core.async.

There are a number of dependencies for the `utils` ns, these should be dev dependencies and only required if you optionally want to use any of the middleware provided in that ns.

## Usage
`core.clj` contains everything needed to create, start, and stop and queue consumer. Starting the consumer will run it in the current thread, futures or executors can be used to run it in the background.

`utils.clj` contains ring like middleware to take care of some of the common processing you might want to do on a message

```clj
(require [sqs-consumer.core :as queue.core]
         [sqs-consumer.utils :as queue.utils])

(defn create-queue-consumer []
  (queue.core/create-consumer :queue-url "sqs-queue-name"
                              :max-number-of-messages 5
                              :shutdown-wait-time-ms 2000
                              :process-fn (-> my-function-to-process-a-message
                                              (queue.utils/with-message-decoder queue.utils/decode-sns-encoded-json)
                                              (queue.utils/with-error-handler #(prn % "error processing message")))))

(let [{:keys [start-consumer
              stop-consumer]} (create-queue-consumer)]
    (.addShutdownHook (Runtime/getRuntime)
                      (Thread. (fn []
                                 (log/info "shutting down")
                                 (stop-consumer))))
    (log/info "listening for messages...")
    (start-consumer))
```

### Queue URL vs Queue Name

If you pass `queue-url` then `queue-name` will never be used. If you only pass `queue-name` then `queue-url` will be looked up; AWS will throw an exception if a Queue with that name cannot be found. If neither are passed then an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.

## TODO
 - [ ] deps.edn?
 - [ ] Don't hard code visibility timeout
 - [ ] Support being able to extend message timeout
 - [ ] Better documentation
 - [ ] Choose a license?
 - [ ] Tests
 - [ ] metadata from SQS and SNS is lost during the deserialisation, maybe some of that is needed?
 - [ ] Should we be using `pmap` or `map` across message?
 - [ ] Can we lose the dependency on `data.json`?


## Local development

Testing is done inside docker so no Clojure or AWS depencies are required.
Required tools:
 - Docker
 - Docker Compose
 
### Running the tests
```
docker-compose build && docker-compose run --rm sqs_consumer lein test
```
