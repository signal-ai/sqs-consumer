# sqs-consumer
A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Rationale

There are a few alternative SQS queuing libraries. None of them focus on creating components that can easily be started and stopped gracefully. This library focusses on solving just that problem.

Libraries should tie you into using the fewest number of other libraries as possible. For example this library will never tie you into an implementation of components such as Stuart Sierra's components or Mount components. This library should work with what ever choice you make. The same is true for async code, we don't want to tie you into core.async.

There are a number of dependencies for the `utils` ns, these should be dev dependencies and only required if you optionally want to use any of the middleware provided in that ns.

## Usage
`core.clj` contains everything needed to create, start, and stop and queue consumer. Starting the consumer will run it in the current thread, futures or executors can be used to run it in the background.

`utils.clj` contains ring like middleware to take care of some of the common processing you might want to do on a message

```clj
(require [signal.nla-article-percolator.queue.core :as queue.core]
         [signal.nla-article-percolator.queue.utils :as queue.utils])

(defn create-queue-consumer []
  (queue.core/create-consumer :queue-url "sqs-queue-name"
                              :max-number-of-messages 5
                              :shutdown-wait-time-ms 2000
                              :process-fn (-> my-function-to-process-a-message
                                              (queue.utils/with-message-decoder queue.utils/decode-sns-encoded-json)
                                              (queue.utils/with-error-handler #(prn % "error processing message")))))

(let [{:keys [start-consumer
              stop-consumer]} (create-queue-consumer)]
    (.addShutdownHook (Runtime/getRuntime)
                      (Thread. (fn []
                                 (log/info "shutting down")
                                 (stop-consumer))))
    (log/info "listening for messages...")
    (start-consumer))
```

## TODO
 - [ ] Better documentation
 - [ ] Choose a license
 - [ ] metadata from SQS and SNS is lost during the deserialisation, maybe some of that is needed?
 - [ ] Should we be using `pmap` or `map` across message?
 - [ ] Can we lose the dependency on `data.json`
